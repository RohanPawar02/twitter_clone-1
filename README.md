I have build a highly scalable basic twitter clone application
A simple Twitter Clone project application is created by using VS Code, Java Script, Django, CSS, and Html.
To mimic the basic design and functionality of the official twitter app.
Git hub was used to push and Heroku was used in deploying purposes. 
The Demo app contains feed component which has two subcomponents- tweet box and post button to upload.
It also collect the tweet messages and image URL
Once a tweet get posted. The designing of this application allows a user to edit, delete or like a tweet or image.
The like button gives you the countdown of image or tweet like.
The tweet also contains a profile image in twitter clone project.
